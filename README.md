# Deep Learning Course: Assignment 7
Using DL Keras Library:
  1. Go to Kaggle.com and register the Kaggle and sign in your Kaggle account.
  2. Open a new Kaggle Notebook.
  3. Do the lab assignment 3 and 4 using Keras DL library.
  
  Follow the methodology illustrated below:
    1. Load the data
    2. Explore the data
    3. Divide the data into the training and testing dataset
    4. Normalizing data
    5. Implement the DL model
    6. Train the model using traing data
    7. Tune the hyper-parameters
    8. Evaluate the quality of the trained model using test dataset
    9. Make prediction using trained model
    
  4. Make your Kaggle notebook public and share your Kaggle Notebook link
