# Deep Learning Course: Assignment 7
Using DL Keras Library:
  1. Go to Kaggle.com and register the Kaggle and sign in your Kaggle account.
  2. Open a new Kaggle Notebook.
  3. Do the lab assignment 3 and 4 using Keras DL library.
  
  Follow the methodology illustrated below:
    - Load the data.
    - Explore the data.
    - Divide the data into the training and testing dataset.
    - Normalizing data.
    - Implement the DL model.
    - Train the model using traing data.
    - Tune the hyper-parameters.
    - Evaluate the quality of the trained model using test dataset.
    - Make prediction using trained model.
    
  4. Make your Kaggle notebook public and share your Kaggle Notebook link
